# Word Building Battles - Setup Instructions

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

The Word Building Battles game has been fully implemented in your React/TypeScript project with:

- **Complete Game Logic**: 60-second timer, 7-letter rack, word validation, scoring
- **Cyberpunk UI**: Matches your existing Game Arena theme
- **Firebase Integration**: Saves game sessions and updates leaderboard
- **Dictionary Validation**: Uses client-side word list for fast validation
- **Letter Scoring**: Scrabble-like point system with length bonuses
- **Interactive Rack**: Click letters to build words
- **Real-time Stats**: Timer, score, and word list display

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **The game is ready to play!** Go to your Game Arena and click "Play Now" on the Word Building Battles card.

2. **Test the game**:
   - Click letters from your rack to build words
   - Submit valid words to score points
   - Game ends after 60 seconds
   - Your score is saved to Firebase

## 🔧 Firebase Setup (Required)

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules

Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` to your Firebase Console:

```bash
# Option 1: Using Firebase CLI
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Option 2: Manual via Firebase Console
# Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
# Copy and paste the content from firestore.rules
```

### 2. Verify Collections

The game automatically creates these Firestore collections:

- **`game_sessions`**: Individual game records
- **`leaderboard`**: User points and rankings

No manual setup needed - they're created on first use.

## 📖 Dictionary Management

The game uses `/public/words-dictionary.json` with ~500 common words.

### To Update Dictionary:

1. **Replace the file**: Update `/public/words-dictionary.json`
2. **Format**: JSON array of lowercase strings
3. **Size**: Keep under 50k words for fast loading

Example larger dictionary:
```json
["ability","absence","academy","account","accurate","achieve","address","advance","advice","affair","affect","agent","agreement","airport","alarm","album","alcohol","alert","alien","alive","allow","almost","alone","already","also","alter","although","always","amazing","among","amount","ancient","anger","angle","angry","animal","annual","another","answer","anxiety","anymore","anyone","anything","anywhere","appear","apple","apply","approach","area","argue","arise","army","around","arrange","array","arrive","arrow","article","artist","aside","assist","assume","attack","attempt","attend","attract","audience","author","auto","available","average","avoid","awake","award","aware","away","awesome","awful","baby","back","badge","badly","balance","ball","band","bank","banner","bare","barely","barn","base","basic","basket","battle","beach","bean","bear","beat","beauty","became","because","become","bedroom","beer","before","began","begin","being","bell","belong","below","belt","bench","bend","beneath","benefit","beside","best","better","between","beyond","bike","bill","bind","bird","birth","bite","bitter","black","blade","blame","blank","blast","bleed","blend","bless","blind","block","blood","bloom","blow","blue","board","boat","body","boil","bold","bomb","bond","bone","book","boom","boost","boot","border","bore","born","boss","both","bother","bottle","bottom","bought","bound","bowl","brain","branch","brand","brave","bread","break","breed","brick","bridge","brief","bright","bring","broad","broke","broken","brown","brush","buck","build","built","bulk","bull","bump","bunch","burn","burst","bury","bush","business","busy","butter","button","buyer","cable","cage","cake","call","calm","came","camp","campaign","campus","cancel","cancer","candy","cap","capable","capital","captain","capture","card","care","career","careful","carry","case","cash","cast","cat","catch","cause","cave","ceiling","cell","center","central","century","chain","chair","challenge","champion","chance","change","channel","chapter","charge","chart","chase","cheap","check","cheese","chest","chicken","chief","child","choice","choose","chosen","church","circle","citizen","city","civil","claim","class","classic","clean","clear","click","client","climb","clock","close","closer","cloud","club","clue","coach","coal","coast","coat","code","coffee","cold","collect","college","color","column","combine","come","comedy","comfort","comic","command","comment","commit","common","company","compare","compete","complex","computer","concept","concern","concert","conclude","concrete","condition","conduct","conference","confirm","conflict","confuse","connect","consider","consist","constant","contact","contain","content","contest","context","continue","contract","control","convert","cook","cool","cope","copy","core","corn","corner","correct","cost","cotton","couch","could","council","count","country","county","couple","courage","course","court","cousin","cover","crack","craft","crash","crazy","cream","create","credit","crew","crime","crisis","critic","crop","cross","crowd","crown","crucial","cruel","cruise","cry","crystal","culture","cup","curious","current","curve","custom","customer","cut","cycle","dad","daily","damage","dance","danger","dare","dark","data","date","daughter","dawn","day","dead","deal","death","debate","debt","decade","decide","decision","declare","deep","defend","degree","delay","deliver","demand","depend","depth","describe","desert","design","desk","detail","detect","develop","device","devote","dialogue","diamond","diary","dice","die","diet","differ","digital","dimension","dinner","direct","director","dirty","disable","disagree","disaster","discover","discuss","disease","dish","dismiss","disorder","display","distance","distinct","distribute","district","dive","divide","doctor","document","dog","door","double","doubt","down","dozen","draft","drag","drama","dramatic","draw","dream","dress","drill","drink","drive","drop","drug","dry","due","dull","during","dust","duty","each","eager","ear","early","earn","earth","ease","east","easy","eat","economic","economy","edge","edit","educate","effect","effort","eight","either","elect","electric","element","eliminate","else","emerge","emotion","emphasis","employ","empty","enable","end","enemy","energy","engage","engine","enhance","enjoy","enormous","enough","ensure","enter","entire","entry","environment","episode","equal","equipment","escape","especially","essay","essential","establish","estate","estimate","even","evening","event","ever","every","evidence","exact","examine","example","exceed","excellent","except","exchange","excited","exclude","excuse","execute","exercise","exist","exit","expand","expect","expensive","experience","experiment","expert","explain","explore","explosion","expose","express","extend","extra","extreme","eye","fabric","face","fact","factor","fail","fair","faith","fall","false","familiar","family","famous","fan","fancy","far","farm","fashion","fast","fat","fate","father","fault","favor","fear","featu

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Game Parameters
```typescript
<WordBuildingBattles
  duration={60}        // Game length in seconds
  rackSize={7}         // Number of letters in rack

## �� Data Structure

### Game Sessions (`game_sessions` collection)
```typescript
{
  uid: string,              // Player's Firebase user ID
  mode: "word_building_battles",
  score: number,            // Final score
  aiScore: number | null,   // AI score if enabled
  duration: number,         // Game duration
  rack: string,             // Initial letter rack
  words: string[],          // Words found
  createdAt: Timestamp      // When game was played
}
```

### Leaderboard (`leaderboard` collection)
```typescript
{
  points: number,           // Total accumulated points
  lastPlayed: Timestamp,    // Last game time
  displayName: string       // Player display name
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Game Not Loading
- Check Firebase connection status (bottom-right indicator)
- Verify dictionary file exists at `/public/words-dictionary.json`
- Check browser console for errors

### Words Not Accepted
- Ensure words are in the dictionary
- Check minimum length requirement (default: 3 letters)
- Verify letters are available in rack

### Scores Not Saving
- Check Firebase authentication
- Verify Firestore rules are deployed
- Check network connectivity

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Play test** the game with different users
2. **Monitor** Firebase usage and costs
3. **Expand** dictionary if needed
4. **Add features** like daily challenges or multiplayer
5. **Optimize** for mobile experience

The game is now fully functional and ready for your users! 🎉
